### Task : Draw the bounding boxes on the images using the labels from the labels directory. 
####  Description : Hope you remember the dataset from the previous test. We are going to draw bboxes on the images from that dataset. Now we are going to draw the bounding boxes on those images using the labels. The labels' format is as below
```
label, x1, y1, x2, y2
```
#### The label value will be 0, 1 or some number. Put that label on top of bounding box. x1 and y1 are the coordinates of point at the top left corner and x2 and y2 are those at the bottom right corner.
